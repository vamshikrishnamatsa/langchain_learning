LangChain Learning 🚀

This repository contains my initial hands-on practice with LangChain, where I explored its core components and built simple implementations to understand how it works.

📌 About

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides modular components that can be combined to create powerful AI workflows such as chatbots, document analysis tools, and intelligent agents.

In this repo, I practiced and implemented:

🔹 Prompts – building prompt templates

🔹 LLMs – connecting with models for text generation

🔹 Chains – linking multiple components together

🔹 Output Parsers – structuring and formatting model responses

🛠️ Tech Stack
